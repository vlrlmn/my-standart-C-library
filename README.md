# 🛠️ My C Foundations Repository

This repository contains foundational C programming projects developed during my studies at [42 School](https://42.fr/). These projects showcase my understanding of low-level programming, memory management, and algorithmic thinking.

## 🚀 Projects

### 1. **Libft**  
A custom implementation of the C standard library.  
- 📌 Includes commonly used string manipulation, memory allocation, and utility functions.  
- 🧵 Extended with additional helper functions for personal use (f.e. split python analog - ft_split.c).

Clone this repository and navigate to each project's directory to compile and run the code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vlrlmn/my-standart-C-library
cd Libft
make
```

### 2. **get_next_line**  
A function to read a line from a file descriptor.  
- 📂 Handles file input/output one line at a time.  
- 🛠️ Supports dynamic memory allocation and buffer management.  
- ⚡ Optimized for efficiency while reading large files.

```bash
cd ../get_next_line
make
```
---

### 3. **ft_printf**  
A custom implementation of the `printf` function in C.  
- 💡 Handles formatted output with specifiers (`%d`, `%s`, `%p`, etc.).  
- 🔧 Developed without using standard library functions like `printf` itself.  
- 🏗️ Includes support for variable-length arguments using `stdarg`.

```bash
cd ../printf
make
```

## 🌟 Highlights
- **Memory Management:** Manual allocation and deallocation using `malloc` and `free`.
- **File Descriptors:** Worked with files, standard input/output, and low-level I/O operations.
- **Custom Implementations:** Rebuilt core functionalities to deepen understanding of C.
